A lightweight Obsidian plugin that lets you mention people with `@`, just like you would in a chat or social media. Type `@` followed by a name, pick from the suggestions, and a wiki-link is inserted automatically.

## Features

- **Smart fuzzy search** — finds people even with partial input, typos in word order, or accent differences
  - `"john"` matches **John Doe**
  - `"jose"` matches **José García**
  - `"jd"` matches **John Doe** (initials)
  - `"doe jo"` matches **John Doe** (multi-word)
- **Frontmatter aliases** — match people by nicknames or alternate names defined in their YAML frontmatter (opt-in)
- **Alias as display text** — optionally show a person's alias as the visible link text (e.g. a link to `@john-doe` displays as `Uncle John`) while the link still points to the file (opt-in)
- **Backlink-based ranking** — people you reference often appear higher in suggestions, with a slight recency boost for recently edited notes
- **Triggers next to punctuation** — the `@` works glued to symbols such as `(@jo`, `"@jo` or `-@jo`, not just after a space. Emails like `name@host` are left alone, and so is an `@` used as a word: `Cena @ 21:00` never opens the suggester, since a mention has its name glued to the `@`
- **Stays out of code** — suggestions never open inside a code block, an inline code span, YAML frontmatter, math, or an existing `[[wikilink]]`, so `@decorator`, `@media` or `@types/node` written *inside code* are left alone (in prose they still work)
- **Ready for the next word** — optionally leave a space after an inserted link so you can keep typing, skipped when a space or a closing symbol already follows (opt-in)
- **Clean names for new people** — when creating a person, surrounding spaces (the ones phone keyboards add when accepting a word) are trimmed, repeated spaces are collapsed, and characters that no file name accepts (`\ / : * ? " < > |`) or that would break the wikilink (`# ^ [ ]`) are removed, so `@ John  Doe ` creates `@John Doe.md` and not a broken link or a look-alike duplicate. The suggestion shows the exact name that will be created; existing people are always linked by their real file name
- **Link selected text** — select any text, run the command **"At People: Link selected text to person"** from the palette, and convert it into a person link instantly. Assign a hotkey (e.g. `Ctrl+Shift+A`) for even faster linking.
- **Dismiss with Escape** — press `Esc` to dismiss suggestions; they won't reappear until you type a new `@` (per note, and only for that `@`)
- **Auto-create files** — optionally create person files and folders on the fly when selecting a suggestion
- **Flexible folder modes** — store people as flat files, per-person folders, or grouped by last name
- **Styleable links** — person links get the `at-person` CSS class and a `data-at-person` attribute in both Reading view and Live Preview, so you can format them with your own CSS (e.g. as `@`-pills); an optional built-in pill style is included
- **Contact import (VCF)** — turn a vCard (`.vcf`) export into person notes in one step; each contact becomes a note with its details written to the frontmatter as properties, using a configurable template (phone, email, organization, title, birthday, address, website, note)

## Installation

### From Community Plugins

1. Open [At People in the Obsidian plugin directory](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=at-people), or go to **Settings > Community plugins** and search for **"At People"**
2. Click **Install**, then **Enable**

### Manual

1. Download the latest release from [Releases](https://github.com/backmind/obsidian-at-people/releases)
2. Extract to `<vault>/.obsidian/plugins/at-people/`
3. Reload Obsidian and enable the plugin in **Settings > Community plugins**

## Important: file naming

By default, person files must start with `@` in their filename:

```
People/
  @John Doe.md
  @Sarah Connor.md
```

The `@` prefix clearly distinguishes person notes from regular notes in your vault.

If your people files don't use `@` (e.g. you already have a folder of contacts named `John Doe.md`), you can disable **Require @ prefix** in settings. The plugin will then treat every `.md` file inside your people folder — including subfolders — as a person.

> **Warning:** with the prefix disabled, make sure your people folder contains only person files. Any `.md` file in it will appear in suggestions.

## Configuration

Settings follow the same order as the plugin's settings tab: **Files & folders**, **Links**, **Aliases**, **Appearance**.

### People folder

Set the folder where your person files live (e.g. `People/`, `Contacts/`, `Reference/People/`). The plugin scans this folder and all subfolders for person files.

### Folder mode

Choose how person files are organized:

| Mode | Structure | Example link |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| **Default** | One file per person | `[[People/@John Doe.md\|@John Doe]]` |
| **Per Person** | A folder per person (for related notes) | `[[People/@John Doe/@John Doe.md\|@John Doe]]` |
| **Per Lastname** | Grouped by last name | `[[People/Doe/@John Doe.md\|@John Doe]]` |

Per Person and Per Lastname modes require Explicit links to be enabled.

> **Note on last names**: the plugin takes the last word of the name as the last name. "Charles Le Fabre" becomes "Fabre", not "Le Fabre".

### Auto-create files

When enabled, selecting a suggestion automatically creates the person file (and any necessary folders) in your configured people folder. When disabled, the plugin inserts the link but you need to create the file yourself.

> **Tip**: If you use [Templater](https://github.com/SilentVoid13/Templater), you can assign a template to your people folder in Templater's settings (*Folder Templates*). Every new person file created by At People will then be pre-filled with your template automatically.

### Require @ prefix

Enabled by default. When enabled, only files starting with `@` are recognized as people. When disabled, all `.md` files in the people folder are treated as people. See [file naming](#important-file-naming) for details.

### Explicit links

By default, the plugin inserts simple links:

```
[[@John Doe]]
```

Enable **Explicit links** to include the full path:

```
[[People/@John Doe.md|@John Doe]]
```

### Add a space after the link

Disabled by default. When enabled, a space is left after an inserted link so you can keep typing straight away, which saves a keystroke on a phone keyboard.

The space is skipped when the text after the link already starts with a space or with a closing symbol such as `)` or `,`. It cannot know about a mark you type *afterwards*, though: with this on, typing `@john` and then `.` gives `[[@John Doe]] .` with the period pushed away from the link. Leave it off if you often end sentences with a mention.

### Include aliases

Disabled by default. When enabled, the plugin reads the `aliases` field from each person file's YAML frontmatter and includes them in the search. For example, if `@María García.md` contains:

```yaml
---
aliases:
  - Mary
  - mamá
---
```

Typing `@Mary` or `@mamá` will suggest **María García**. The suggestion shows the matched alias so you know why it appeared (e.g. `María García (via Mary)`). The inserted link always points to the canonical person name.

### Use alias as display text

Off by default, and only available when **Include aliases** is enabled. Controls whether a generated link uses a person's frontmatter alias as the *visible* text. The link target never changes; only the displayed text does:

- **Off** — always use the file name.
- **Always prefer alias** — use an alias whenever the person has one.
- **Only when matched by alias** — use the alias only when you searched by it; searching by the file name keeps the file name.

For example, if `@john-doe.md` has the alias `Uncle John`, the inserted link becomes `[[@john-doe|Uncle John]]`. A person with no alias always uses the file name.

### Style person links as pills

Disabled by default. When enabled, person links are shown as tag-style pills in Reading view and Live Preview, reusing your theme's tag colors (a pill with `@` instead of `#`). Prefer your own look? See [Styling person links](#styling-person-links) below.

### Reset to defaults

A button at the bottom of the settings tab restores every setting to its default value. It asks for a second click to confirm, so a stray tap cannot wipe your configuration.

## Styling person links

In both Reading view and Live Preview, every person link receives:

- the CSS class `at-person`
- a `data-at-person="<name>"` attribute holding the person's name (without the `@` prefix)

This lets you target person links from your own CSS snippet or theme. For example, to render them as pills with `@` instead of `#`:

```css
.at-person {
	background-color: var(--tag-background);
	color: var(--tag-color);
	font-size: var(--tag-size);
	padding: var(--tag-padding-y) var(--tag-padding-x);
	border-radius: var(--tag-radius);
	text-decoration: none;
}
```

To style a specific person, use the data attribute:

```css
.at-person[data-at-person="Jane Doe"] {
	color: var(--color-red);
}
```

Don't want to write CSS? Enable **Style person links as pills** in settings for a built-in version of the look above.

## How ranking works

Results are ranked by combining three factors: how closely the query matches the name (with a slight preference for shorter, more precise matches), how often the person is referenced across your vault, and a light recency boost for recently edited person notes. Frequently mentioned people naturally rise to the top, while still respecting the relevance of your current query.

## Troubleshooting

**Suggestions stopped opening in a note.** The `@` is ignored inside code, frontmatter and math, and an *unclosed* `$$` or code fence makes everything below it count as math or code, in the editor's eyes as much as the plugin's. Look for a stray `$$` or ``` above the spot. The **"Link selected text to person"** command works anywhere, so you can still link while you sort the note out.

**Suggestions won't come back for one `@`.** Pressing `Esc` dismisses that specific `@` on purpose. Type a new one, or move to another line, and it returns.

## Conflicts

Some plugins conflict with the `@` symbol. Check the [known plugin conflicts](https://github.com/backmind/obsidian-at-people/issues?q=is%3Aissue+conflict+) to see if yours is listed.

## Comparison

| | **At People** | **[At Symbol Linking](https://github.com/Ebonsignori/obsidian-at-symbol-linking)** |
|---|---|---|
| Size | ~45 KB | ~145 KB |
| Focus | People only | Multiple entity types |
| Multi-symbol support | `@` only | `@`, `$`, etc. mapped to different folders |
| Alias support | Yes (frontmatter) | Yes |
| Fuzzy search | Accent-insensitive, multi-word, initials | Standard |
| Backlink ranking | Yes | No |
| File templates | No | Yes |

Choose **At People** if you want a fast, focused solution for person linking. Choose **At Symbol Linking** if you need broader symbol-to-folder mapping.

## Contact import

Turn a vCard (`.vcf`) export from your phone or contacts app into person notes in one step. Each contact becomes a note named **`@First Last`** (built from the vCard `N` field) and is placed directly in your **People folder**. The note's frontmatter is generated by a [Templater](https://github.com/SilentVoid13/Templater) template, so you can fully customize it.

> **Requires the Templater plugin.** Install and enable Templater, then use the **Create / Update Contact Template** button in settings to write the default template into your vault.

### Setup

1. Install and enable the **Templater** community plugin.
2. In **At People → Contact import**, set the **Contact Template path** (default `Templates/Contact Template.md`).
3. Click **Create / Update Contact Template** — this writes a default Templater template to that path (overwrite-safe; edit it afterwards).
4. Use the **Import contacts from VCF** command (or button) to open the importer, then paste vCard text or pick a `.vcf` file already in your vault.

### What gets imported

The importer injects each contact's data into the template via `window._ct`. The default template writes these properties (only when present):

- `phone` — phone numbers (`TEL`, multiple joined)
- `email` — email addresses (`EMAIL`)
- `company` — organization (`ORG`)
- `job title` — title (`TITLE`)
- `birthday` — `BDAY`
- `address` — `ADR`
- `website` — `URL`
- `note` — `NOTE`
- `photo` — the contact picture (`PHOTO`): saved as an attachment in `<People>/attachments/` and embedded in the note

The note is named `@First Last` and Templater's `tp.file.move` drops it straight into your People folder. Edit the template to rename properties, change the layout, or add more `window._ct` fields.

### Importing

Use the **Import contacts from VCF** command (or the **Import from VCF** button in settings) to open the importer. You can either:

- paste vCard text directly into the box, or
- choose a `.vcf` file that already lives in your vault.

Existing person files (same name) are skipped, and a Notice reports how many contacts were imported. After import, the new people appear in `@` suggestions immediately.
